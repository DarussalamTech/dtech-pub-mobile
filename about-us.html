            <section>HISTORY</section>
            <p>Darussalam Publishers was established in 1986 by Mr. Abdul Malik Mujahid in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The inspiration of Darussalam came to him after he read about the largest publishing institute of Lebanon, owned by a non-Muslim and dedicatedly working for the propagation of their religion. He also realized that previously published Islamic books lacked quality publishing and contained many academic mistakes. In view of this situation, he aimed at establishing an institute for the printing and publication of Islamic research work and named it as Darussalam.</p>
            <p>Over the past two decades, Darussalam has established its publishing centers in many countries. It has the distinction of having a dedicated team of eminent scholars and researchers, who are engaged in the preparation of the academic plans and scriptures. Darussalamâ€™s aim was to print authentic Arabic text of the Quran, its translation in different languages, and publication of brief commentaries and marginal notes on it. After the successful experience with initial publications, it diversified into other domains like Fiqh, Seerat, and Biographies.</p>
